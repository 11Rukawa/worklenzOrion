# Recurring Tasks: User Guide

## What Are Recurring Tasks?
Recurring tasks are tasks that repeat automatically on a schedule you choose. This helps you save time and ensures important work is never forgotten. For example, you can set up a recurring task for weekly team meetings, monthly reports, or daily check-ins.

## Why Use Recurring Tasks?
- **Save time:** No need to create the same task over and over.
- **Stay organized:** Tasks appear automatically when needed.
- **Never miss a deadline:** Tasks are created on time, every time.

## How to Set Up a Recurring Task
1. Go to the tasks section in your workspace.
2. Choose to create a new task and look for the option to make it recurring.
3. Fill in the task details (name, description, assignees, etc.).
4. Select your preferred schedule (see options below).
5. Save the task. It will now be created automatically based on your chosen schedule.

## Schedule Options
You can choose how often your task repeats. Here are the most common options:

- **Daily:** The task is created every day.
- **Weekly:** The task is created once a week. You can pick the day (e.g., every Monday).
- **Monthly:** The task is created once a month. You can pick the date (e.g., the 1st of every month).
- **Weekdays:** The task is created every Monday to Friday.
- **Custom:** Set your own schedule, such as every 2 days, every 3 weeks, or only on certain days.

### Examples
- "Send team update" every Friday (weekly)
- "Submit expense report" on the 1st of each month (monthly)
- "Check backups" every day (daily)
- "Review project status" every Monday and Thursday (custom)

## Tips
- You can edit or stop a recurring task at any time.
- Assign team members and labels to recurring tasks for better organization.
- Check your task list regularly to see newly created recurring tasks.
